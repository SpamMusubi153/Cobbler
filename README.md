Interact with the Gemini REST API using Pure Apple Shortcuts

---

This set of shortcuts provides a pure Apple Shortcut interface for users to  interact with Google's 1.5 Pro Gemini model.

Right now, these shortcuts are capable of taking care of:

- The (sometimes tedious) process of constructing and extracting information from the JSON requests used to communicate with the Gemini REST API.

- Through **Gemini Conversations**, keeping track of and sending conversation history so users can have multi-turn interactions.

- Through **Gemini Conversations**, providing system instructions to shape model responses.

Originally, I created this series of shortcuts for my grandmother, who haden't yet been able to try a "chatbot". Using this shortcut, I was able to bridge the currently free Gemini LLM (Large Language Model, from Machine Learning) to Apple's iMessage, a service she is familiar with.

If enough users are interested, I might investigate adding additional features to these shortcuts, such as:

- Additional Gemini configuration options
- Multi-user conversations
- A demonstration of integration with Apple iMessages to automatically reply to messages.

### How to Get Started

1. Register for a Gemini API Key from Google at
https://ai.google.dev/


> API stands for "Application Program Interface". It is a common way **two programs exchange data.** In this exchange, your API Key is **like a password**, so make sure to keep it safe! Here, we'll be using it to connect Google Gemini to our Apple Shortcut.

2. Run the **Save API Key** shortcut below to save a copy of your key to your device.

>> If you want to do this manually, you can copy and save your API key to a file called "Key.txt" at the following path:
>> 
>>iCloud Drive > Apps > Gemini > Preferences > Key.txt

3. Follow the instructions below for either running the **Gemini Basic** or **Gemini Conversations** shortcut.

**Congratulations!** You can now interact with Gemini on your device through Apple Shortcuts!
